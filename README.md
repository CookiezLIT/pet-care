Ionic App for PDM uni lab


I have created an app for pet management and reservations for different services such as vets and pet saloons.

PetDetails:
-name : str
-birth_date : date
-age : int
-photo : binary[]


Once they are logged in, users can:
1)Users can add, edit or delete pets.
2)Make appoitments to vets or pet saloons.
3)The pet data is persited on the device and will be available while offline.
4)While online, users cand make an appoitment.
5)When an appoitment is made, an email is recevied using an external service.
6)Users can take a picture of their pet using their phone and upload it in the app.
